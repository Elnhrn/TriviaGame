A trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
If the player selects the correct answer, a screen will display congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, the next question will be shown without user input.

The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

If the player runs out of time, the player's time is up and the correct answer will be shown. After a few seconds, the next question will be displayed. If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player will be shown that they selected the wrong option and then the correct answer they missed. After a few seconds, the next question will pop up. On the final screen, the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page) will be displayed.
